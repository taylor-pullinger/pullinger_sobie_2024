# pullinger_sobie_2024
A repository for the code used in the 2024 manuscript by Pullinger and 
Sobie

To choose the desired settings and run the vulnerable window protocol on 
one or more cables use Rush-Larsen/CN_local_script.m

The conductance multipliers for 17 conductances in a population of 400 CMs,
for 7 potential sigma values can be found in Populations/minicombo.mat

The selection of which of the 400 CMs comprise each sample cable is also 
included in the Populations directory.

The ToRORd19 folder contains code needed to run the Tomek et al. 2019 model 
on isolated CMs.
